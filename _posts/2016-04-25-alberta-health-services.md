Alberta Health Services &#8211;Â Trentent and Saman setup and configured a province-wide Citrix XenApp environmentÂ for AHS. This included migrating thousands of users from old, unsupported farms and hundreds of applications. Â They also setup AppV5 to work with our XenApp infrastructure to give us large flexibility in how we choose to deploy or configure our servers.
