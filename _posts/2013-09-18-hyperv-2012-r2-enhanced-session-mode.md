I hate it when I read "wow Hyper-V 2012 R2 now comes with enhanced session mode, allowing you to redirect audio, usb, etc to the client VM!"

I was excited to read about that until I also read it only works on Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. &nbsp;So much for it working on Windows 7 or other guest VM's.

Disappointing.
