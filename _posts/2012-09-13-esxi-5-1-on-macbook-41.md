Well... &nbsp;I got ESXi 5.0 installed on the MacBook but I was unable to get Mountain Lion to work. &nbsp;VMWare just came out with ESXi 5.1 which [supports Mountain Lion](https://blogs.vmware.com/guestosguide/2012/09/mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion.html) so I attempted to install ESXi 5.1 on a USB key and get it up and running on my MacBook. &nbsp;5.1 was a little different from 5.0 as the installerhelper.sh appears to operate differently...? &nbsp;Anyways, what I had to do was slipstream the sky2 driver into the ESXi 5.1 image, boot into "ESXi 'No Network Adapters Found'" then Fn-Option-F1 into the console. &nbsp;I then typed the following commands:

vmkload_mod sky2  
esxcfg-init -n  
vmkload_mod lvmdriver  
install

Without the lvmdriver the install would not see the storage (USB or HDD)

I am now installing ESXi 5.1 onto my MacBook. &nbsp;Hopefully, I'll be able to run Mountain Lion from it ðŸ™‚
