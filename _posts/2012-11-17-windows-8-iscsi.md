iSCSI and Windows 8 changes

It appears Windows 8 has removed the CriticalDeviceDatabase key. &nbsp;Or, it looks like it just moved it to HKLMSystemControlSet001ControlDeviceLocations. &nbsp;Under the old CDD key there was thousands of listings of hardware ID&#8217;s that were useless. &nbsp;It appears they just eliminated them and then renamed CDD to DeviceLocations.

There you go.
