I wrote a new Script Based Action (SBA) for ControlUp for console based access to my physical machines, but in reality it should work for any machine you have local admin access on. Â This SBA will accomplish the same thing as the old &#8216;PushVNC&#8217; of days of yore, but with ControlUp Â ðŸ™‚

The first thing you need to do is download a VNC client (my preference, and the VNC server client for this SBA will be based off of) [like TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php).
