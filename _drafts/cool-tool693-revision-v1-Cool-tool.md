Mariano Sergio Cosentino created a script that will convert registry keys into ADMX template files. This is awesome as the alternative to deploying large number of registry keys and values is typically a startup script with regedit.exe /s %regfile%.

Tool is available here:  
http://www.mscosentino.com/desarrollos/reg2admxl/reg\_2\_admx.vbs

Usage is: CSCRIPT REG\_2\_ADMXL.vbs registry-file language [name]

I used this tool to create a ADMX template of the following registry key:  
KEY\_CURRENT\_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWindows Messaging Subsystem

We use Microsoft fRX and it utilizes this key to determine your mail prefences if you&#8217;re using exchange. If you have the old Office 2000/2003 (IIRC) you should have this key. 2007 and greater now use a different method of storing email account information (apparently). This content is generated by using the &#8220;Mail&#8221; control panel icon. We used this tool to prestage the server name and a &#8220;Windows Messaging Profile&#8221; so that when you try to email from fRX you don&#8217;t go through a complicated wizard asking for things like &#8220;server name&#8221;. If you&#8217;re organization is like ours, your internal email server name is something users won&#8217;t know and won&#8217;t be able to guess (eg, 3-digit-company-abbr,3-digit-code-for-prod-or-dev,3-digit-code-for-virtual-or-physical,3-digit-code-for-server-role(eg EXC-exchange),3-digit-code-for-number).
