In the coming days I intend to put up quite a few recipes for AppV5 applications that I have done, including some solutions I&#8217;ve implemented to some tricky problems I&#8217;ve come across. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure others may come up with some better solutions to what I will be proposing but I&#8217;m going to lay it bear as the solutions I&#8217;ve done, though probably not the best, do work. &nbsp;Most of my work revolves around getting AppV5 setup for a Citrix/RDS type scenario but a lot of the work applies to for VDI as well.

That said, here is how I do AppV5:

Setting up the AppV5 sequencer.  
Setting up the AppV5 client for apps on RDS/Citrix
