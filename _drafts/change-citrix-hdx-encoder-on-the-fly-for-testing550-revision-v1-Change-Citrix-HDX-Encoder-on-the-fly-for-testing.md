[Rachel Berry](https://virtuallyvisual.wordpress.com/) posted an article on [optimizing HDX for gaming.](https://virtuallyvisual.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/did-i-really-see-a-165-thin-client-doing-55fps-with-borderlands-2-with-hdx-3d-pro-citrix-xendesktop/)Â In this article she highlighted that Citrix has some &#8216;special&#8217; registry keys for modifying [different parameters of the Thinwire encoder](https://virtuallyvisual.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/hdx-and-h-264-artefacts-in-citrix-xendesktopxenapp/). Â One of these keys was changing the encoder itself:

  * Encoder = 2 is Pure H.264 (YUV 4:2:0). As with most vendors this is H.264 4:2:0 format, itâ€™s designed for a balance of quality and bandwidth primarily on video and high-bandwidth CAD parts (not much text). This is used by the HDX 3D Pro VDA.
  * Encoder = 1 is H.264+lossless text. This is used by default by the XenDesktop standard VDA and XenApp VDA.
  * Encoder = 0 forces you to use Compatibility mode

In terms used by HDX, it shakes out like so:

Encoder 2 = DeepCompressionEncoder  
Encoder 1 = DeepCompressionV2Encoder  
Encoder 0 = CompatibilityEncoder

The cool thing about these encoders is you can modify their values \*on the fly\* and it will take place immediately in your Citrix session. This video I made demonstrates this. I ran a 3D benchmark application and modified the encoder&#8217;s on the fly. I zoomed into the FPS counter and put this in the bottom left corner as the text with moving images shows much better the difference in the encoders. Â Without a doubt, the CompatibilityEncoder has the worst quality of all the encoders when it comes to video/moving images/3D/gaming.

Try to watch it in 1080p for maximum quality.

    To change the encoder, you need to add/modify a registry key at HKLM\Software\Citrix\Graphics. Â The type is DWORD32 named &#8220;Encoder&#8221; and the value is 0x0 to 0x2, depending on the encoder you want to try and use.

    All testing was done with XenApp 7.6 on my home built lab.
