&#8220;I can launch my first app no problem, but when I try and launch my second app the screen flashes and my second application doesn&#8217;t appear.&#8221;

So <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I</strong></span> try launching two applications and I get the same symptoms. Â First one launches, second app stalls. Â What a way to start a Monday.
