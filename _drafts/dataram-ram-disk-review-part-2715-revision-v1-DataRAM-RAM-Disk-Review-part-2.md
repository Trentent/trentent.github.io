I&#8217;ve purchased some RAM to replace my 1GB sticks. This new RAM allows my system to operate at 1333MHz DRAM speed without issues. So, I&#8217;ve set my RAM to this new bandwidth speed and my memory went to:

</div>

<div>
  14099MB/s Read, 12034MB/s Write, 16901MB/s Copy.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  This represents an improvement of:
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  23% Read, 0% Write, 10% Copy.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  With a 23% Read performance improvement will DataRAM&#8217;s RAMDrive solution improve?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It does not.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It appears something else is holding the performance of the RAMDrive software down. IOMeter *did* see some improvement (from 5000Mb/s to 5094MB/s&#8230; a 1.9% improvement) but pretty insignificant from what it *should* be, if it was hardware being the hold up.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The &#8220;bandwidth&#8221; of the RAMDrive is 40Gbps, a pretty large leap from the maximum you could get from SATA at it&#8217;s best (6Gbps), but I hope DataRAM investigates what the performance ceiling is of their software and can explain or correct what&#8217;s causing it.

</div>

<div>
  Overall though, I&#8217;m still happy with the software and for a free 4GB RAM disk or $10 for a maximum of ~64GB, I think it&#8217;s a great value. I have 18GB of RAM in my system and utilize this software for programs like StarCraft or VMWare machines and the loading speeds are great.
