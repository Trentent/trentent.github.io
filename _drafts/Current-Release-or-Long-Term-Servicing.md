Challenges on staying on LTSR &#8211;>Â further you get from the original release date to &#8220;today&#8221; you start losing.

    Yes, the problem is the windows update agent on RTM is too old to process that update from WSUS. So to mitigate, injected SSU and CU into reference image as an OS package. 2018-11 CU, 2018-11 SSU, 2018-09 Update, and 2018-05 SSU.
